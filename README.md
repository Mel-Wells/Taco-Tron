# Taco Tron

Taco Tron is a futuristic-themed taco restaurant website developed for the HTML final project with Codedex. This project showcases a sleek, neon-inspired design combined with a fully responsive menu and interactive order form.

## Overview

Taco Tron features:
- A visually appealing menu displaying a variety of taco options.
- An interactive order form that allows users to select taco quantities, choose add-ons (such as cheeses and drinks), and leave special requests.
- A glow effect on form elements when clicked, implemented using JavaScript to enhance user interaction.
- A clean, modern design using Google Fonts (Orbitron, Exo 2, and Michroma).
- A responsive layout built with HTML and CSS (including Flexbox and Grid).

## Technologies Used

## Challenges Faced

Every project comes with its own set of challenges â€” big or small. For this project, I encountered issues implementing spinning 3D figures, which ultimately interfered with mobile friendliness. To maintain accessibility for everyone, I decided to remove those animations and focus on creating a responsive design.

## Things Learned

I learned a variety of skills during this project, including developing an effective color scheme, designing an intuitive UI, and creating a uniquely styled form. This project further demonstrates my ability to create a responsive website that prioritizes accessibility.
